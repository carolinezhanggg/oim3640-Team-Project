## The Big Idea

The main idea of the project is to help travelers plan their trip when they arrive in the designated city. We plan to create a website that allows users to input the city name, and it outputs the current weather, predicted weather for the next day, top 5 restaurants and parks of the city. To generate the output, we plan to use API to get the information of weather, and use website scraping from Yelp to get the information of restaurants. We can also use the map API to explore whether there is any national or provincial park near the designated location. The stretch goal would be providing more detailed suggestions based on the weather and available places to explore. For example, if it might be rainy on the next day, the website output would suggest the user to bring an umbrella. Moreover, it would be better if the website can plan a travel schedule for the user. For example, it would suggest to the user when to go to which place in the city, and how long it would take to visit each location. 

## Learning Goals

The shared learning goals for us are improving skills of writing advanced codes, debugging, and accessing data through API. Also, we want to learn more about how to apply our knowledge in class to real life situations and generate values. 
Individually, we want to work better as a team and improve our communication skills through coding. Also, for each of us, the goal would be trying to understand others' aspects when solving problems, and combining our thoughts to form the final solution. 

## Implementation Plan

We will design a website that as users enter the place they want to search, the website will return a list of top restaurants, top hotels, and top view sights that are rated by Yelp. Also the website will return the current weather of the place and try to predict which activity is best to do under such weather conditions. We will try to get our data using the API provided by Yelp and Openweather. When predicting the activity under different weather conditions, we will design a function that returns certain activities corresponding to certain weather conditions.

## Project schedule

In the upcoming week we will make sure of the data sources and how to access the data properly. 
Following week we will begin to write the framework of the project and try to draw the sketch of the code. Discussing which functions and libraries will be used.
After that week we will begin to write the detailed code and make sure all the functions are fulfilled according to our initial plan. Debugging the code.
In the last week of the project, we will finalize our code and ask some unsolved questions to the professor and think of possible improvements to our projects. 

## Collaboration plan

We plan to brainstorm together about what functions and resources we need for the project, and then write codes for different functions separately. In this way, we can not only make sure that both of us are on the right track but also inspire each other while solving problems and writing codes. If we are stuck at any question, we will first try to communicate online using Webex or Slack, if it’s necessary, we plan to meet face to face and sit together to solve the problem. When we finish our part of coding, we will set up a face to face meeting and combine our code together. At this point, we can check each other’s code for any mistake. 
While we work separately, it is hard to see the real time updates for our codes, so we definitely will check in with each other regularly (every 2 days) about the working progress and specific codes. 
In this way, we are not limited to certain type of thinking and can better explore possible solutions to the task. 

## Risks

The biggest risk might be inability to access the desired data and not meeting our desired outcomes. Since the data from Yelp might change frequently and be hard to scrape, we might need to find other resources to get the information of what are some good restaurants or parks in the designated city. Also, since rating restaurants are objective for customers, we need to be cautious about using what criteria to rank the top 5 restaurants. 

## Additional Course Content

Topics about using API to search for data and using html and flask to build a website would be essential to our project. Also, the website scraping is helpful for us to get more specific information.
